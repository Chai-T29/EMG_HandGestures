EMG Hand Gesture Classification

Introduction

This project focuses on classifying hand gestures using Electromyography (EMG) data. The data is sourced from the (UCI Machine Learning Repository)[#https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/481/emg+data+for+gestures] and consists of recordings from 36 participants performing 8 distinct gestures. Each gesture lasts for 3 seconds, and the aim is to compare the performance of windowing versus non-windowing data processing techniques for gesture classification. This work evaluates deep learning and machine learning models, leveraging hardware acceleration for efficient signal processing, which has significant implications for real-time applications like robotic prosthetics.
